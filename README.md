By incorporating use of customer profile and sentiment analysis through the Twitter API, we aim to increase Woolworths customer growth and loyalty. 

Part 1: Customer Profile
- Searches for tweets from users using keywords, in order to identify their interests and consumption of products. This allows for personalised advertising and increased customer engagement.

Part 2: Sentiment Analysis
- Sorts tweets addressed at Woolworths based on public sentiment, and finds the most common phrases in such tweets in a time period. Trends, positive aspects and areas of improvement of Woolworths' products and service can be identified from this analysis.
